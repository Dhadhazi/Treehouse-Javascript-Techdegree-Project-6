            Saitama (サイタマ, Saitama) is the main protagonist of One-Punch Man and the most powerful being to exist in the series. Saitama faces a self-imposed existential crisis, as he is now too powerful to gain any thrill from battle.[3]

            Initially just a hero for fun,[4] Saitama later registers to be a professional hero for the Hero Association[5] and defends his home in Z-City from monsters, villains, and other threats.[6] Under the Hero Association, he is assigned the hero name Caped Baldy (ハゲマント, Hagemanto; Viz: Bald Cape)[7] and is currently ranked 7 in the B-Class.[8]
